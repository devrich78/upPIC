#TO_DO List:

___MISSION-CRITICAL-MUST-BE-DONE Priority Items___

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a way to "save" the upPIC's to various images for the user to then download.  Can't have a "v1.0 - release" until then of course ;-)

***[ W.I.P. ]*** Create a custom set of colors and shades for users to choose from!



___HIGH-PRIORITY TO_DO LIST ITEMS GO HERE___

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a color palette for the users to be able to select a custom color!!

***[ To-Do ]*** Add a Color Picking Tool with a custom textbox that the user can enter their desired color

***[ To-Do ]*** Add a Color Picking Tool with the ability to put together a shaded column of gradient values
                from one textbox color to another textbox color

***[ To-Do ]*** Build in the ability to tell the user what Hex color _AND_ what RGB value a color selection is!!

***[ To-Do ]*** Build in the ability to pick a color from an image from the web.. hmm.. somehow..



***[ FIXED ]*** Change "grid box cell borders" to something more meaningful as to not confuse anyone ( like me )
                 SOLUTION: Feb-12-2015 -- Corrected the names, ids, tags, css, etc etc to showcase the new official name of the grid box cells to be called from this point forward the "Edit Grid" which is filled with "Edit Cells" ( make's life easier )



___Regular-Priority TO_DO List items:___

***[ To-Do ]*** Add in a feature to allow the user to specify how often the grid box cell borders are re-drawn

***[ To-Do ]*** Add a Color Picking Tool with the 140 'web safe' color palette




___Additional TO_DO List items:___

___Possible New Features To Consider Adding In___

[ Ver 2 possibility ] <a href="http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/" target="_blank">Spectrum on GitHub ( http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ )</a>
                      ^-- Because this is a really really good color picker tool

#Conventions Used:

___First and Foremost___

Version 1.0 is to be entirely 100% my programming only for several reasons but mostly these three:

* I want to have a good "base" for others to start from when making modifications/additions/forks

* I want to program it 100% on my own with minimal help and only when absolutely needed

* I'm trying to get used to how GIT and GitHub work :-)

Version 1.1 will be the first release where I will allow others to make pull requests and contributions, again so that we can all have a good base to start from :-)


___Why not use a pre-made custom color picker?___

* I've decided that unless another option is asked to be considered to go with this one starting in Version 2.0 or sooner: 
  <a href="http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/" target="_blank">Spectrum on GitHub ( http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ )</a>
  ^-- Because this is a really really good color picker tool
  
  To more answer that question as to why I haven't included it already: Because I wanted to make version 1.0 as 100% my-code-only as possible in order to give us a good base to start with.
  This way if down the line someone decides to move away from a feature or change a feature completely then the option would be built-in to allow them to do so without too much effort ;-)
