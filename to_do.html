[Priority-one/MileStone] ***[ To-Do ]*** To cut down on major spikes in bandwidth and some forms of possible DDoS attacks on my server; I'm going to build in that an IP Address may only submit an image once every 60 seconds -- I wish I didn't have to do that but it's for everyone's protection so that we can all continue to use the server :-)

                 ^---- For Instance:
                                     Shape_1 ==        XX
                                                      H00H
                                                       XX

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a way to allow users to create their own shapes to "share" with everyone in our "Shape DataBase" _AND_ allow users to mark the "Shapes" as "Private" or "Public" -- "Private" is the default setting and it means that _only_ that user can see and use the "Shape" whereas "Public" is a permanent setting that once set can not be UNset and that adds their "Shape" to our "Shape DataBase" for everyone to use :-)

***[ To-Do ]*** Add a Color Picking Tool with a custom textbox that the user can enter their desired color

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a way to take the custom input box (for users to be able to specify their own colors to choose from) and make several color "sgades" based on that color for users to select from!
***[ To-Do ]*** Add a Color Picking Tool with the ability to put together a shaded column of gradient values
                from one textbox color to another textbox color

***[ To-Do ]*** Build in the ability to tell the user what Hex color _AND_ what RGB value a color selection is!!

___Possible New Features To Consider Adding In___

[ Ver 2 possibility ] <a href="http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/" target="_blank">Spectrum on GitHub ( http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ )</a>
                      ^-- Because this is a really really good color picker tool

#Conventions Used:

___First and Foremost___

Version 1.0 is to be entirely 100% my programming only for several reasons but mostly these three:

* I want to have a good "base" for others to start from when making modifications/additions/forks

* I want to program it 100% on my own with minimal help and only when absolutely needed

* I'm trying to get used to how GIT and GitHub work :-)

Version 1.1 will be the first release where I will allow others to make pull requests and contributions, again so that we can all have a good base to start from :-)


___Why not use a pre-made custom color picker?___

* I've decided that unless another option is asked to be considered to go with this one starting in Version 2.0 or sooner: 
  <a href="http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/" target="_blank">Spectrum on GitHub ( http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ )</a>
  ^-- Because this is a really really good color picker tool
  
  To more answer that question as to why I haven't included it already: Because I wanted to make version 1.0 as 100% my-code-only as possible in order to give us a good base to start with.
  This way if down the line someone decides to move away from a feature or change a feature completely then the option would be built-in to allow them to do so without too much effort ;-)
