#TO_DO List:

___DONE_ITEMS!!___

***[ DONE! ]*** Create a color palette for the users to be able to select a custom color!!
***[ DONE! ]*** Create a custom set of colors for users to choose from!
***[ DONE! ( I Think, ish ) ]*** Add a Color Picking Tool with the 140 'web safe' color palette

***[ FIXED ]*** Change "grid box cell borders" to something more meaningful as to not confuse anyone ( like me )
                 SOLUTION: Feb-12-2015 -- Corrected the names, ids, tags, css, etc etc to showcase the new official name of the grid box cells to be called from this point forward the "Edit Grid" which is filled with "Edit Cells" ( make's life easier )



___MISSION-CRITICAL-MUST-BE-DONE Priority Items___

***[ To-Do ]*** Create the core php pages that will take the [:.:] data from a POST and convert it to images then provide a "time-limited by 24 hours" set of images that users can download both directly and as a zip

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a core php/mysql user login system that will allow users to permanently "save" their [:.:] data remove the "time-limited by 24 hours" for the users so that they can always come back and get their [:.:] :-)

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a way to "save" the upPIC's to various images for the user to then download.  Can't have a "v1.0 - release" until then of course ;-)

***[ To-Do ]*** "UNDO" Create a way to allow users to "UNDO" actions that they take __AND__ allow users to see a full "UNDO List" so that they know what they've done and can decide if they want to "UNDO" or not.




___HIGH-PRIORITY TO_DO LIST ITEMS GO HERE___

==== "Undo/Redo" Feature ====
***[ To-Do ]*** ?? "REDO" Create a way to allow users to "REDO" actions that they take

==== "Shapes Feature" ====
***[ To-Do ]*** "Shape Stamp" Create a way to allow users to "Stamp" a selected "Shape" whereever they like!

***[ To-Do ]*** "Shapes" Create a way to allow users to specify a pre-determined "Shape" from a "List of Shapes" and then specify the colors/alphas to use in the "Shape"'s "Shape Palatte":
                 ^---- For Instance:
                                     Shape_1 ==        XX
                                                      H00H
                                                       XX
                                     X == #0000FF
                                     H == #00AAFF
                                     0 == #2f2f2f

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a way to allow users to create their own shapes to "share" with everyone in our "Shape DataBase" _AND_ allow users to mark the "Shapes" as "Private" or "Public" -- "Private" is the default setting and it means that _only_ that user can see and use the "Shape" whereas "Public" is a permanent setting that once set can not be UNset and that adds their "Shape" to our "Shape DataBase" for everyone to use :-)

***[ To-Do ]*** "Shape Rotate" Create a way to allow users to "Rotate" a "Shape" clockwise/counter-clockwise by 90 degrees ( NOTE: only make it 90 degrees for now to keep things simple for the time-being) !




***[ To-Do ]*** Create a way to allow users to specify any image from the internet to 'load' in as a background image behind the cells and pixelboxes so that they can see how their creations stack on top of specific images :-)

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a custom set of shades from the custom colors for users to choose from!

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a custom input box for users to be able to specify their own colors to choose from!
***[ To-Do ]*** Add a Color Picking Tool with a custom textbox that the user can enter their desired color

***[ To-Do ]*** Create a way to take the custom input box (for users to be able to specify their own colors to choose from) and make several color "sgades" based on that color for users to select from!
***[ To-Do ]*** Add a Color Picking Tool with the ability to put together a shaded column of gradient values
                from one textbox color to another textbox color

***[ To-Do ]*** Build in the ability to tell the user what Hex color _AND_ what RGB value a color selection is!!

***[ To-Do ]*** Build in the ability to pick a color from an image from the web.. hmm.. somehow..

___Possible New Features To Consider Adding In___

[ Ver 2 possibility ] <a href="http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/" target="_blank">Spectrum on GitHub ( http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ )</a>
                      ^-- Because this is a really really good color picker tool

#Conventions Used:

___First and Foremost___

Version 1.0 is to be entirely 100% my programming only for several reasons but mostly these three:

* I want to have a good "base" for others to start from when making modifications/additions/forks

* I want to program it 100% on my own with minimal help and only when absolutely needed

* I'm trying to get used to how GIT and GitHub work :-)

Version 1.1 will be the first release where I will allow others to make pull requests and contributions, again so that we can all have a good base to start from :-)


___Why not use a pre-made custom color picker?___

* I've decided that unless another option is asked to be considered to go with this one starting in Version 2.0 or sooner: 
  <a href="http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/" target="_blank">Spectrum on GitHub ( http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ )</a>
  ^-- Because this is a really really good color picker tool
  
  To more answer that question as to why I haven't included it already: Because I wanted to make version 1.0 as 100% my-code-only as possible in order to give us a good base to start with.
  This way if down the line someone decides to move away from a feature or change a feature completely then the option would be built-in to allow them to do so without too much effort ;-)
