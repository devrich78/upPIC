#Top FAQ Questions about [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)]

___Why is your repository (repo) called/labeled "upPIC" and not___ [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] ___?___

Because when I went to create the repo and typed in [:.:] I got a yellow message box saying that if I created the repo as [:.:] then it: "Will be created as -.-" which is a pretty cute smilie face but not the name of this project ;-)


___What is___ [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] ___?___


[[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] <-- this ASCII text logo represents my very first GitHub project "user profile Pixelated Image Creator". 


___What is your "user profile Pixelated Image Creator" project all about ?___

"user profile Pixelated Image Creator" ( _pronounced:_ "up" "pic" ) is my very first GitHub project.  It is a web-based ( initially ) and cross-platform/cross-industry system, concept, and user-interface that is specifically designed to allow you to create your own pixelated Profile-Picture/Display-Image 'on-the-fly' for use anywhere and everywhere ( just mention upPIC is all i ask if you like it ).


___Where did the idea for___ [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] ___come from?___

I created an account for the first time over here on GitHub and got a pretty cool 5x5 pixelated image which GitHub calls a "Identicon":

```php
                                         _____
                                        |  #  |
                                        | ### |
                                        |  #  |
                                        | ### |
                                        |#####|
                                         -----
```
And I love that image but I wanted to be able to create my own image and 'beef' it up ( so to speak ).  So I came up with the simple idea of making some design and construction process for creating my own "Pixelated Iamges".


__Why is your GitHub Profile-Picture different than above?__

The image above was my very first ( and favorite ) GitHub Profile-Picture that I ever got but this is the one that I had while designing [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)]

```php
                                         _____
                                        | ### |
                                        |## ##|
                                        |# # #|
                                        |#####|
                                        |#####|
                                         -----
```


__Why put this up on GitHub.com ?  Isn't this something you are making just for yourself ?__

When I came up with the idea, I essentially felt like sharing this would be great! Not just great but more than great!

I want to share this with the world and have everyone help me build as much awareness for [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] as possible!


__How can I help build awareness for upPIC ?__

One way to help build awareness is to put my --> [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] ASCII logo in the footer of your website or somewhere as a link back to my upPIC repo.  Something like this:

```html
<a href="http://Github.com.devrich78/upPIC/" alt="upPIC - Make your own pixelated Profile-Picture/Display-Image or avatar!!">[:.:]</a>
```

Another way to help is to use upPIC to create your own Profile-Picture/Display-Image or Avatar and then use it and tell your family and friends all about how easy it is :-)



___What/where/how can I use the images created with___ [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] ___for:___

[[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] is designed primarily as a Profile-Picture/Display-Image creator; however you can also use the images created with [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] in any project or website you want as well as many other places!  For example; here are some general ideas:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|  * Forums  |  * Blogs  |  * School Locker  |  * Book or Bumper Stickers  |
|  * Icons  |  * Images  |  * Animated Gifs  |  * Animated-Other-Images  |
|  * Avatars  |  * Profile Picture  |  * Display Images  |  * T-Shirts ( This is my fanorite thing to do!! )  |
|  * Comics  |  * Graphic Novels  |  * Novels  |  * Cutscenes for Video Games  |
|  * Videos  |  * Video Clips  |  * Video Game Images  |  * AND A WHOLE LOT MORE!!  |


___Who "owns" the images created with___ [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] ___?___

Essentially; the image(s) created with [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] are owned by the person(s) who used [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] to create the image(s) as long as they follow these simple stipulations:

1: Considering that there are only a finite possible number of images you can create with [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] -- if you and someone else both create the same image then I ask you all to not sue, threaten, or otherwise disrepect or bring harm to each other.  Let's all get along and use [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] for our own personalizational awesomeness :-D

2: Another stipulation is that I don't want you to copyright the images created with [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] "directly" -- However; if you combine/embed the image(s) that you create with [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] into other image(s) not created with [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] then that is ok to copyright, however you agree NOT to attempt to interfer with or prevent others using [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] who may create the same image(s) as yours to copyrighting their own creations as long as they also combine the image(s) they create with [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] by combining/embedding them with other images... hmmm i should probaably re-word that better... but you get the idea, let's all play nice, and play fair :-)


___Did you trademark the___ [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] ___ASCII logo?___

YES - please note that the [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] ASCII logo is one of my trademarks as of January 1st, 2015 -- HOWEVER; you may all use the [[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/).[:](http://GitHub.com/devrich78/upPIC/)] logo anywhere and in any way you wish ___as long as___ you do ___not___ disrepect it/me/this_project/other_contributors_to_this_project/GitHub/etc and I ask that you also provide a link back to this GitHub repository or my website.

Many thanks for your support on that and because of your continued support, I plan to always keep upPIC free for everybody!
