Top FAQ Question:

Why is your repository (repo) called/labeled "upPIC" and not "[:.:]" ?

Because when I went to create the repo and typed in [:.:] I got a yellow message box saying that if I created the repo as [:.:] then it: "Will be created as -.-" which is a pretty cute smilie face but not the name of this project ;-)


#What is [:.:] ?

[:.:] user profile Pixelated Image Creator is a system, concept, and user-interface design that is specifically designed to allow you to create your own pixelated Display Image.


#Where did the idea for [:.:] come from?

I created an account for the first time over here on GitHub and got a pretty cool 5x5 pixelated image:

```php
                                         _____
                                        |  #  |
                                        | ### |
                                        |  #  |
                                        | ### |
                                        |#####|
                                         -----
```
