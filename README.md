Top FAQ Question:

Why is your repository (repo) called/labeled "upPIC" and not "[:.:]" ?

Because when I went to create the repo and typed in [:.:] I got a yellow message box saying that if I created the repo as [:.:] then it: "Will be created as -.-" which is a pretty cute smilie face but not the name of this project ;-)


#What is [:.:] ?

[:.:] user profile Pixelated Image Creator is a system, concept, and user-interface design that is specifically designed to allow you to create your own pixelated Display Image.


#Where did the idea for [:.:] come from?

I created an account for the first time over here on GitHub and got a pretty cool 5x5 pixelated image:

```php
                                         _____
                                        |  #  |
                                        | ### |
                                        |  #  |
                                        | ### |
                                        |#####|
                                         -----
```
And I love that image but I wanted to be able to create my own image and 'beef' it up ( so to speak ).  So I came up with the simple idea of making some design and construction process for creating my own "Pixelated Iamges".


#What/where/how can I use the images created with [:.:] for:

[:.:] is designed primarily as a Display Image creator; however you can also use the images created with [:.:] in any project or website you want as well as many other places!  For example; here are some general ideas:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|  * Icons  |  * Images  |  * Animated Gifs  |  * Animated-Other-Images  |
|  * Avatars  |  * Profile Pics  |  * Display Images  |  * T-Shirts ( This is my fanorite thing to do!! )  |
|  * Comics  |  * Graphic Novels  |  * Novels  |  * Cutscenes for Video Games  |
|  * Videos  |  * Video Clips  |  * Video Game Images  |  * AND A WHOLE LOT MORE!!  |


#Who "owns" the images created with [:.:] ?

YOU and well "i" i guess... Essentially; the image(s) created with [:.:] are owned by the person(s) who used [:.:] to create the image(s) as long as they follow these simple stipulations:

1: Considering that there are only a finite possible number of images you can create with [:.:] -- if you and someone else both create the same image then I ask you all to not sue, threaten, or otherwise disrepect or bring harm to each other.  Let's all get along and use [:.:] for our own personalizational awesomeness :-D

2: Another stipulation is that I don't want you to copyright the images created with [:.:] "directly" -- However; if you combine/embed the image(s) that you create with [:.:] into other image(s) not created with [:.:] then that is ok to copyright, however you agree NOT to attempt to interfer with or prevent others using [:.:] who may create the same image(s) as yours to copyrighting their own creations as long as they also combine the image(s) they create with [:.:] by combining/embedding them with other images... hmmm i should probaably re-word that better... but you get the idea, play nice, and play fair :-)
