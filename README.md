#[:.:] user profile Pixelated Image Creator

#Top FAQ Questions about [:.:]

___Why is your repository (repo) called/labeled "upPIC" and not___ __[:.:]__ ___?___

Because when I went to create the repo and typed in [:.:] I got a yellow message box saying that if I created the repo as [:.:] then it: "Will be created as -.-" which is a pretty cute smilie face but not the name of this project ;-)


___What is___ __[:.:]__ ___?___


[:.:] <-- this ASCII text logo represents my very first GitHub project "user profile Pixelated Image Creator". 


___Did you trademark the___ __[:.:]__ ___ASCII logo?___


YES - please note that the [:.:] ASCII logo is one of my trademarks as of January 1st, 2015 -- HOWEVER; you may all use the [:.:] logo anywhere and in any way you wish ___as long as___ you do ___not___ disrepect it and provide a link back to this GitHub repository or my website.  Many thanks for your support on that and because of your continued support, I plan to always keep upPIC free for everybody!


___What is your "user profile Pixelated Image Creator" project all about ?___
"user profile Pixelated Image Creator" is my very first GitHub project.  It is a web-based ( initially ) and cross-platform/cross-industry system, concept, and user-interface that is specifically designed to allow you to create your own pixelated Display Image 'on-the-fly' for use anywhere and everywhere ( just mention upPIC is all i ask if you like it ).


___Where did the idea for___ __[:.:]__ ___come from?___

I created an account for the first time over here on GitHub and got a pretty cool 5x5 pixelated image:

```php
                                         _____
                                        |  #  |
                                        | ### |
                                        |  #  |
                                        | ### |
                                        |#####|
                                         -----
```
And I love that image but I wanted to be able to create my own image and 'beef' it up ( so to speak ).  So I came up with the simple idea of making some design and construction process for creating my own "Pixelated Iamges".


___What/where/how can I use the images created with___ __[:.:]__ ___for:___

[:.:] is designed primarily as a Display Image creator; however you can also use the images created with [:.:] in any project or website you want as well as many other places!  For example; here are some general ideas:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|  * Icons  |  * Images  |  * Animated Gifs  |  * Animated-Other-Images  |
|  * Avatars  |  * Profile Pics  |  * Display Images  |  * T-Shirts ( This is my fanorite thing to do!! )  |
|  * Comics  |  * Graphic Novels  |  * Novels  |  * Cutscenes for Video Games  |
|  * Videos  |  * Video Clips  |  * Video Game Images  |  * AND A WHOLE LOT MORE!!  |


___Who "owns" the images created with___ __[:.:]__ ___?___

YOU and well "i" i guess... Essentially; the image(s) created with [:.:] are owned by the person(s) who used [:.:] to create the image(s) as long as they follow these simple stipulations:

1: Considering that there are only a finite possible number of images you can create with [:.:] -- if you and someone else both create the same image then I ask you all to not sue, threaten, or otherwise disrepect or bring harm to each other.  Let's all get along and use [:.:] for our own personalizational awesomeness :-D

2: Another stipulation is that I don't want you to copyright the images created with [:.:] "directly" -- However; if you combine/embed the image(s) that you create with [:.:] into other image(s) not created with [:.:] then that is ok to copyright, however you agree NOT to attempt to interfer with or prevent others using [:.:] who may create the same image(s) as yours to copyrighting their own creations as long as they also combine the image(s) they create with [:.:] by combining/embedding them with other images... hmmm i should probaably re-word that better... but you get the idea, play nice, and play fair :-)





___Why do you keep adding abbreviations ( abbr ) in your text, it's odd ?___

The reason is because of completeness but mostly it's to help new comers to the abbreviations ( also to help me rememeber certain new abbreviations I have learned such as "repo" for meaning a "GitHub.com Repository" ).

I'll try to avoid doing it too much as to not annoy anyone.
