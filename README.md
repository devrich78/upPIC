Why is your repository (repo) called/labeled "upPIC" and not "[:.:]"?
Because when I went to create the repo and typed in [:.:] then i got a yellow message box saying that if I created the repo as [:.:] then it: "Will be created as -.-" which is a pretty cute smilie face but not the name of this project ;-)
