#Instructions For Installing

Installing is simple.  Very simple.  Just copy all of the files from this folder to any folder on your php enabled webserver.

Besure to upload all of the files "AS-IS" and with***___out___*** modifying them in any way.

NEXT: Just make a URL link to the file -> "uppic.html".

Done.

Enjoy! :-)


#Requirements:

To create the images; your server must be running php version 5.4.0 or higher becasue by default we use the alpha component which as described here --> [http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagecolorset.php](http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagecolorset.php) <-- php 5.4.0 is required since that is the version of php when they added support for the alpha ( transparent ) component.
