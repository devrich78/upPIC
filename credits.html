<h1>Credits Page</h1>
<pre>
[:.:] is a project "upPIC" created by me; "Rich" and I am a developer, artist, writer, and much more :-)
<br>My Website is: <a href="http://DevRich78.com" target="_blank">http://DevRich78.com</a>
<br><br>
This credits page is to give proper credits to everyone that helps with upPIC's development.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you feel that you should be included in this list and for some random reason I haven't already added you then please contact me so that I can give proper credit where credit is due ( i do my very best to keep this updated and accurate so appologies if I missed anyone! ) :-)
